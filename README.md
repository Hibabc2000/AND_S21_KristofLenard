# AND_S21_KristofLenard

Main topic: Voting/voter information app (I got the idea after a long brainstorming session (yeah, I'm not good at it), when I went up on Facebook and heard more about the entire political situation in Hungary (my home country). Yeah, no comment. So, I figured I would try something that would help if we ever got back to being democratic, instead of fake-democratic.)

# Requirements:

MUST HAVE:

 - The app must be able to record voter information, and verify it.
 - The app must be able to store votes, and communicate it to a server.
 - The app must authenticate users and verify that they are legitimate voters.
 - The app must be able to give users more detail on voting options and candidates.

SHOULD HAVE:

 - The app should be designed in a way that it is easy to use and adaptable for users with handicaps. 
 - The app should notify users when there is a significant change in either the informational part, or a vote starts.
 - The app should be adapted to at least two languages.

COULD HAVE:

 - The app could have an API linker part, so that if an API is developed for any new features (see Won't have for ideas), then there is something ensuring compatibility.
 - The app could be adaptable to different voting systems.

WON'T HAVE:

 - The app will not communicate in any way with any official databases to retrieve voter information.
 - The app will not store any personal data besides an app-based ID, their name, their date of birth, and their votes.
 - The app will not be compliant with any regulations concerning data handling, or anything else as required by law.

Note during (theoretically) last upload: App was not tested (I had some problems with the emulator)
